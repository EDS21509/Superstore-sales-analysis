 Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard (2015–2018)

## Overview
This project analyzes retail sales performance from 2015 to 2018 using a Superstore dataset.
The analysis was originally performed in Excel and then recreated and enhanced in Tableau to demonstrate data visualization, dashboard design, and business-focused analysis.

The final deliverable is an interactive Tableau dashboard that summarizes sales trends, category and regional performance, and top-selling products.

## Business Questions
- How have total sales changed over time?
- Which product categories generate the most sales?
- Which regions contribute the most to overall sales?
- What are the top 10 products by sales?

## Key Insights
- Sales increased significantly after 2016, with 2018 being the strongest year.
- Technology is the highest-performing product category by total sales.
- The West and East regions generate the highest sales.
- A small number of products account for a large portion of total revenue.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Sales growth is primarily driven by Technology products and strong performance in the West and East regions, with revenue concentrated among a small number of top products.
