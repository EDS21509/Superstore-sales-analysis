 Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard (2015–2018)

## Overview
This project analyzes retail sales performance from 2015 to 2018 using a Superstore dataset.
The analysis was originally performed in Excel and then recreated and enhanced in Tableau to demonstrate data visualization, dashboard design, and business-focused analysis.

The final deliverable is an interactive Tableau dashboard that summarizes sales trends, category and regional performance, and top-selling products.

## Business Questions

- Which product categories generate the most sales?
